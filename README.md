SAMANTHA MCDONOUGH
Who is samantha McDonough?
I dont know.  How could I not know, I am samantha McDonough, because I am not one thing there isn't one sentiment at my core that can describe who I am.  I am a product of millions of seperate experiences and people.  I can't be one thing becasue I am always trying to revise my self and find new things that make me feel passionate. I seek activities that will nurture my multifarious array of interests and constantly searching for things that really what drive me.  I leap at opurtonities to further my understanding of who I am. I expanded my intrege for the envirment by investing myself in Sierra club, this led to me taking on the club and becoming president.  This furthered my interest in having leadership roles a school and in my life.  I had to learn to take control of my own life and decide what I was going to let me effect me and what I would let go because life is a journey filled with decisions that contribute to the neverending definition of an individual. Who you surround yourself with and what things you do or read or travel to or see or make is what defines you.  It is everyones responisblity to find what interests them and build themselves up to be the interesting person they are.  Following you passion where every it takes you is how you disscove not who you are but parts and pieaces of yourself because who you are is impossible to answer as we are constatly evolving and isn't made of one thing or three words as many want it to be but a collection of many things that takes a life time to sort out.
